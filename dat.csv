Have felt unheard many times or that R's way of looking at situation was automatically taken in the worst possible light, that the normal stages of grief were not acknowledged in R's situation.  Not allowed time to grieve, and deepened R's grief by taking the children away.  But CPS has taken every possible step to make sure that R's children are placed in foster care with R's same values and have worked closely with R's church.  At the same time, CPS put a lot of pressure on R to do things (legally) that were unfamiliar to R and were not explained well to her, and was not given adequate time to file restraining order paperwork - R didn't understand the process and wasn't given adequate instruction or information needed to comply in  timely fashion.  As a result, R's children wouldn't be taken away..","Was given about 5 minutes lead time (by CPS) before police and social workers arrived to take the children.  In a meeting with CPS, told R that R had not filed all necessary paperwork or complied with CPS service plan.  R claims that CPS had not given all necessary & required paperwork, and had not given a service plan (and so couldn't comply) until R's atty insisted that a service plan be provided.  R had not heard any hopeful messages from CPS until 6 months after removal of children.  R has felt very distressed by the experience of hearing her own words twisted and hearing testimony in court of her own words used against her.  R feels trapped by this - R feels R cannot speak to CPS or let them know her or her family because of this dynamic; feels that positive parenting practices and child development experiences were turned around by CPS and used against R's parenting.",1,"Re: CPS Ws
Have only known most recent W for about a month; haven't had much contact (at atty's advice and because of experiences described above).  Have had more contact with supervisor of visits and overall supervisors.

It would be helpful if Ws would ask clarifying questions like ""what does that statement mean to you?"" or take time to make sure that W really understands the values, the words used, etc. instead of just looking to gather info to build a case.  Could have used a home health nurse to help R and R's children understand the grieving process.

My suggestion is that she not get wrapped up in the negative entity in how they look at parents and since she is new I hope she stays open minded.  With CPS, one person says one thing and they automatically jump on it without investigating.  I don't want her to get caught in the old ways.  It really affects the parents when they come into the home and take their children.  I recognize there are children that need it.  They look at people as a number and not as a person.  Train workers to recognize truth from fiction.  There is so much training that they should have that they don't have.  Another suggestion is to have less cases per case worker.  (R recognizes the government as being the cause of many of the problems).  I feel it is a really big test as in ""Who is ready to be a parent and who isn't""",1,"Our situation has been really hard.  We have been on the other side of things and this time a lot things were taken out of context and cut and pasted.  They were inaccurate.  My fiancees mother (that works as a juvienile caseworker) was horrified at how her words were taken out of context.  Lots of things in our file was totally wrong.  I was proactive in getting my son help and it was turned around on me.  I was so happy to hear about this program.  They can come in and rip your family apart.  I really do hope that things change in the system.  There are a lot things they take way to far.  It should be beyond a shadow of a doubt and complete evidence.  Not just hearsay. We see so many people being angry and being reactive and not proactive.  Our suggestion is for all parents to go through parent classes one per year. (At this point the fiancee stepped and told his part. Biggest complaint is that not everyone is on the same page).

In the 1st report, presented in court, to do a placement with my parents, CPS reported that I was trying to kill myself and was in my bedroom with my children.  I had an accidental overdose and my children were not with me at the time - they were with my father.    Also, should focus on who actually raises children versus blood relation only - re: who can see the children and be with  the children.  I know people who have had bad experiences with CPS, but I have had a good experience overall - because I am a better parent.  I am able to parent because I parent sober.  I wasn't abusive or neglectful, but  I was taking shortcuts.  Now I can feel good about myself and my parents because of the programs and parenting skills I've gained through CPS.

Without any investigation they took my child.  CPS is a nightmare I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  Even when the judge ordered that my child be returned to me, CPS was resistant because they ""felt"" that something was going to happen even though they had no grounds for it.

I have been to everything and have volunteered to do 2 visits/wk in order to get it going faster -- but this has been a financial burden for me because of all the work I have had to miss.  I don't think it is right for families that are really trying to be so financially burdened by CPS' timeline/schedule.  
CPS should try harder to keep siblings together.  
When they are returning children home, usually not all of the children are returned at the same time and I think this is really hard on the kids if they all don't return at the same time because they may not understand the reasons why.","From the beginning, CPS wasn't quick enough to get services going. ie, parenting classes were beginning, I had to keep bugging my caseworker for the referral! Also, I had to prove that I was clean for 60 days, but it wasn't until 40 days after my inital UA that CPS finally got me set up on the color system.  Another thing that wasn't handled right, my 10 yr. old son was sent to counseling by himself and the counselor later said he didn't need it anymore -- but that's because a child can't tell what's really happening. an adult needs to be there.  Also, it's not right when parents aren't  informed about their children while they're in foster care (ie: school reports, doctor visits, etc).  
also, it will be a more difficult transition for my children to come home from foster care because they are now used to being able to do more (like skating ea. fri.).  I am a single mom, I don't have a lot of $ and there are no extras.  I think they should try and keep the foster home similar to the real home.",2,"",140696,1787046,2008-04-01,2008-11-02,2008-11-02,2008-04-01,2011-04-27,4,"Foster",7,"Other",4,"Foster",2008-04-01,2011-04-27,1997-06-20,10,11,3,"Pre to Early Adolescence (10 through 14)",3,"Pre to Early Adolescence (10 through 14)",NA,NA,"F",5,"White/Caucasian",3,"Non-Hispanic, White Alone",216,191,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,2008-04-01,14,"Grays Harbor",3,"Single Female",0,"Reunification",2,3,2011-04-27,2011-04-27,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2008-03-21,2,"Immediate Dependency                                                                                                                                                                                    ",1

The FRS counselor was terrible - if this was a reconciliation counselor, I'd hate to see what a take-away was.  Biggest suggestions were a book, a parenting class, and join a support group.  Had a family team meeting before FRS got involved, and everyone agreed.  FRS counselor disagreed, told R that R needed to accept responsibilities as a parent and bring R's child-in-care home. R's child had been assigned a team child atty, who had contact w/AAG, which resulted in getting an atty, which is what helped.  No real help available from state for teens.  Get adoption support & counseling, but anything bigger the state doesn't do anything - placements or other involvement.  FRS counselor had a bad reputation amongst other counselors and was so unhelpful that supervisors agreed & R turned down all other state services to get away from FRS.","R paid for behavioral placement in OR themselves for 9 months; it did no good.  Finally got to feeling that WA needed to help out.  State didn't properly inform about adopted children (they were FAS); R probably wouldn't have adopted them because of concerns about R's own patience and parenting. Ultimately had to let state file a dependency so WA would provide whatever R's child needs until 18 because R afraid that state would back out if they only did a temporary placement.  If R had an W that really wanted to work with R's family, it wouldn't have cost thousands in fees and it wouldn't have been such a struggle.  Everybody in system says state doesn't provide services and doesn't want to do BRS referral.  Also, state wants to charge parents support.

FRS W shouldn't be in her job and should display more skill and better attitude.",1,"W should have been removed from case, and was supposed to.  W told others that R was just trying to get rid of R's son - told this to residential centers, told R's husband that R was confused, overly emotional, and nuts.  W wouldnt return calls, would direct information in strange ways, etc.

Research protocols are persistent, but it's actually appreciated.  Also, many questions just didn't apply to R.

Curious to see what changes will be implemented, if any, as a result of the study & intervention.  If survey helps it happen, that's great.  But not holding breath after 14 years in the system w/adopted children.  As a rule, most workers have been great and helpful, even if hands tied.
